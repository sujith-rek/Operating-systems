Note: in these tests, a 'page fault' means that a put request did not write
as many bytes as requested.  A 'read fault' means that a get request did not
read as many bytes as requested.  A 'bad read' means that a get read the right
numbers of bytes, but the value that was read was not the same as what was written.



Running 4 threads, each writing all of their memory 5 times with each
of 5 page tables.  Since this can fill but never overfill physical memory,
there should be NO page faults, read faults, or bad reads.


   Started 4 threads.

   Thread  0 finished with 0 page faults,  0 read faults, 0 bad reads
   Thread  1 finished with 0 page faults,  0 read faults, 0 bad reads
   Thread  2 finished with 0 page faults,  0 read faults, 0 bad reads
   Thread  3 finished with 0 page faults,  0 read faults, 0 bad reads



Now run 16 threads, each writing 1/4 of their memory 5 times with each
of 10 page tables.  Since this can fill but never overfill physical memory,
there should again be NO page faults, read faults, or bad reads.

Now repeat with 17 threads.  Since this can overfill overfill physical
memory, there WILL LIKELY be page faults, but there should still be NO
read faults, or bad reads.
